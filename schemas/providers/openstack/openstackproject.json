All cloud\n resources belong to a project, which provides resource isolation, quota\n boundaries, and access control scoping.\n\n Common use cases:\n   - Provision tenant projects for development teams\n   - Create isolated project hierarchies for multi-tenant environments\n   - Automate project onboarding in landing zone InfraCharts\n\n Note: Creating projects is an admin-level operation. The OpenStack credentials\n used with this component must have the \"admin\" role or equivalent permissions.",
