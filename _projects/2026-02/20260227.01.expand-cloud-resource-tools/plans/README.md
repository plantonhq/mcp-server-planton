### Status Legend

- ✅ **Completed**: All phases/tasks finished

### Notes

- Phase 6B (Stack Job Observability) was implemented without a formal Cursor plan file — it was straightforward enough to execute directly from the revised task plan (`tasks/T01_2_revised_plan.md`).
- The Hardening: Documentation session (Session 6) also did not require a formal plan file.
