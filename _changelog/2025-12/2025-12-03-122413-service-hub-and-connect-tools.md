# Service Hub and Connect Tools for MCP Server

**Date**: December 3, 2025

## Summary

Extended the Planton Cloud MCP Server with 8 new tools across two domains (Service Hub and Connect), enabling AI agents to query services, manage Tekton pipelines, and access GitHub credentials. This empowers agents to help users create and modify CI/CD pipelines by providing complete context about their services, Git repositories, and available pipeline templates.

## Problem Statement

Users wanted AI assistance for creating and modifying Tekton pipelines for their services in Service Hub. However, the MCP server lacked visibility into:
- **Service configurations**: No way to query services, their Git repositories, or pipeline settings
- **Git integration**: No access to branch information or GitHub credentials
- **Pipeline templates**: No ability to discover or retrieve Tekton pipeline definitions
- **Repository access**: No way to list available GitHub repositories for service onboarding

This created a significant gap where agents couldn't provide meaningful help for pipeline creation workflows because they lacked the necessary context.

### Pain Points

- Agents couldn't answer "What services do I have?" or "Which GitHub account is my service connected to?"
- No way to discover available Tekton pipeline templates to use as starting points
- Missing Git branch information needed for pipeline configuration
- Couldn't help users explore GitHub repositories accessible via their credentials
- No path forward for the planned agent-assisted pipeline creation workflow

## Solution

Created two new domain packages in the MCP server following the established architecture pattern:

1. **Service Hub domain** (`internal/domains/servicehub/`): Tools for querying services, branches, and Tekton pipelines
2. **Connect domain** (`internal/domains/connect/`): Tools for accessing GitHub credential metadata and repository listings

Each domain includes:
- **gRPC clients** for Planton Cloud APIs with user authentication
- **Tool implementations** with JSON serialization for agent consumption
- **Registration logic** following the MCP server's tool registration pattern
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

### Architecture

```

**Authentication flow**:
- Each tool uses per-user API keys (HTTP: from Authorization header, STDIO: from environment)
- gRPC clients authenticate with Planton Cloud APIs using user credentials
- Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) ensures users only see resources they have access to

## Implementation Details

### Service Hub Tools (4 tools)

**1. `list_services_for_org`**
- Lists all services in an organization
- Returns: Service metadata, Git repo info (owner, name, branches, URLs), pipeline config
- Uses: `ServiceQueryController.find()` with organization filter
- Key for: Discovering available services before creating pipelines

**2. `get_service_by_id`**
- Get complete service details by ID
- Returns: Full service configuration including spec and status
- Uses: `ServiceQueryController.get()`

**3. `get_service_by_org_by_slug`**
- Get service by organization and slug/name
- Returns: Same as get_by_id but lookup by name
- Uses: `ServiceQueryController.getByOrgBySlug()`
- Key for: CLI-style interactions where users provide service names

**4. `list_service_branches`**
- Lists all Git branches for a service's repository
- Returns: Array of branch names
- Uses: `ServiceQueryController.listBranches()` (calls GitHub/GitLab API)
- Key for: Helping users select which branch to configure pipelines for

### Tekton Pipeline Tools (1 tool)

**`get_tekton_pipeline`**
- Get complete pipeline definition with YAML content
- Input: Either pipeline_id OR (org_id + name)
- Returns: Pipeline metadata + full YAML content
- Uses: `TektonPipelineQueryController.get()` or `getByOrgAndName()`
- Key for: Retrieving template pipelines to customize for services

**Note**: Initially planned `list_tekton_pipelines`, but the API only supports get operations (no find/list endpoint). Users must know pipeline IDs or names to retrieve them.

### Connect (GitHub Credentials) Tools (3 tools)

**1. `get_github_credential_for_service`**
- Get GitHub credential associated with a service
- Logic: Fetch service → extract github_credential_id → fetch credential
- Returns: Credential metadata (NO access tokens - security)
- Key for: Understanding which GitHub account connects to a service

**2. `get_github_credential_by_org_by_slug`**
- Get GitHub credential by organization and slug
- Direct credential lookup when you know the credential name
- Returns: Same metadata as above

**3. `list_github_repositories`**
- List all repositories accessible via a GitHub credential
- Input: credential_id
- Returns: Array of repositories (owner, name, web_url)
- Uses: `GithubQueryController.findGithubRepositories()`
- Key for: Discovering available repos when onboarding new services

### API Alignment Challenges

During implementation, discovered several API mismatches that required adjustments:

1. **StringList**: Uses `.GetEntries()` not `.GetValues()`
2. **FindApiResourcesRequest**: Structure differs from expected (requires `page`, `kind`, `org` fields directly)
3. **TektonPipeline API**: Only supports get operations, no listing/finding
4. **TektonPipelineSpec**: Uses `ApiResourceSelector` (kind + id), not a tags array
5. **GitHub repo response**: Uses `web_url` not `browser_url` or `clone_url`

All issues resolved by examining proto definitions and adjusting tool implementations accordingly.

## Benefits

### For AI Agents

- **Complete service context**: Agents can now understand service configurations before helping with pipelines
- **Git integration awareness**: Access to branch info and GitHub credentials enables intelligent pipeline suggestions
- **Template discovery**: Can guide users to appropriate pipeline templates
- **Repository exploration**: Help users choose repositories when onboarding services

### For Users

- **Conversational pipeline creation**: "Help me add a Tekton pipeline to my backend-api service"
- **Service discovery**: "What services do I have in my organization?"
- **Git troubleshooting**: "Which GitHub account is my service connected to?"
- **Repository browsing**: "What repos can I access with my GitHub connection?"

### For the Platform

- **Foundation for agent workflows**: Enables the planned pipeline creation agent workflow
- **Consistent patterns**: Follows established MCP server architecture (domain-based organization)
- **Security-first**: Per-user authentication with FGA ensures data isolation
- **Extensible**: Clear patterns for adding more Service Hub and Connect tools

## Code Metrics

- **New files**: 15 Go files across 2 new domains
- **New tools**: 8 MCP tools total
  - 4 Service tools
  - 1 Tekton pipeline tool
  - 3 GitHub credential tools
- **Documentation**: 
  - Updated README with tool list
  - Created comprehensive `docs/service-hub-tools.md` (350+ lines)
  - Included 3 agent workflow examples

## Agent Workflow Example

**User**: "I want to add a custom Tekton pipeline to my backend-api service"

**Agent workflow**:
1. `list_services_for_org` → Identify services in organization
2. `get_service_by_org_by_slug` → Get detailed service config
3. `get_tekton_pipeline` → Fetch template pipeline YAML
4. `list_service_branches` → Show available branches
5. `get_github_credential_for_service` → Understand Git integration

**Result**: Agent has complete context to guide user through pipeline customization and deployment.

## Impact

### Immediate

- Agents can now assist with Service Hub operations
- Users can explore their services conversationally
- Foundation laid for pipeline creation workflow

### Medium-term

- Enables next phase: Git operations tools (clone, commit, PR creation)
- Sandbox integration for safe pipeline modifications
- Complete end-to-end agent-assisted pipeline creation

### Developer Experience

- Clear domain organization makes adding new tools straightforward
- Consistent error handling patterns improve user experience
- Per-user authentication ensures proper multi-tenant security

## Design Decisions

### Why separate Service Hub and Connect domains?

- **Separation of concerns**: Service Hub manages services/pipelines; Connect manages credentials
- **Future extensibility**: Connect will grow to support GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
- **Reusability**: GitHub credential tools useful beyond just Service Hub

### Why JSON serialization instead of protobuf in tool outputs?

- **Agent compatibility**: JSON is universal across all MCP clients
- **Readability**: Easier for humans to inspect tool outputs
- **Simplicity**: Avoids protobuf version compatibility issues in client tools

### Why not include access tokens in GitHub credential responses?

- **Security**: Access tokens are sensitive and should never be exposed to agents
- **Need-to-know**: Agents only need metadata; actual Git operations happen server-side
- **Audit trail**: Prevents accidental token leakage in logs or conversation history

### Why remove list_tekton_pipelines?

- **API limitation**: Backend API doesn't support listing/finding pipelines
- **Pragmatic choice**: Better to ship with get-by-id/name than wait for list support
- **Future-proof**: Can add listing later when API supports it
