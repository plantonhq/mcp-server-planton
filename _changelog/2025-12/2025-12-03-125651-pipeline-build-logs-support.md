# Pipeline Build Logs Support for MCP Server

**Date**: December 3, 2025

## Summary

Added pipeline build log streaming capability to the Planton Cloud MCP Server, enabling AI agents to access real-time and historical Tekton task logs for troubleshooting service build failures. This completes the foundation for autonomous troubleshooting agents by providing visibility into pipeline execution details and build logs that were previously only accessible through the web console.

## Problem Statement

Users wanted AI assistance for debugging service build failures, but the MCP server lacked access to the critical diagnostic information needed for effective troubleshooting. When builds failed, agents could only see high-level status information without the detailed logs showing what actually went wrong.

### Pain Points

- **No build visibility**: Agents couldn't see what happened during pipeline execution
- **Manual debugging required**: Users had to switch to the web console to view logs
- **Limited troubleshooting context**: Without logs, agents couldn't identify root causes
- **Incomplete workflow**: The planned troubleshooting agent workflow was blocked
- **Reactive only**: No way to analyze historical build failures for patterns

The existing Service Hub tools (added Dec 3) provided service and pipeline metadata, but the missing piece was access to the actual build logs where errors and failures are diagnosed.

## Solution

Extended the MCP server with pipeline build log streaming by exposing ServiceHub's `PipelineQueryController.getLogStream()` RPC. This enables agents to retrieve complete Tekton task logs from both in-progress pipelines (streamed from Redis) and completed pipelines (archived in R2 storage).

### New Components

**gRPC Client** (`internal/domains/servicehub/clients/pipeline_client.go`):
- `NewPipelineClient()` - Client constructor with authentication
- `GetById()` - Fetch pipeline execution metadata
- `GetLogStream()` - Stream Tekton task logs (handles both Redis and R2)
- Follows established authentication pattern (per-user API keys with FGA)

**MCP Tools** (`internal/domains/servicehub/pipeline/`):
- **`get_pipeline_by_id`** - Query pipeline execution status, timing, commit info
- **`get_pipeline_build_logs`** - Stream complete build logs as JSON array

**Registration** (`internal/domains/servicehub/register.go`):
- Integrated pipeline tools into Service Hub domain registration
- Follows existing pattern used for service and tektonpipeline tools

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline Client

The `PipelineClient` wraps the ServiceHub Pipeline gRPC API:

```go
// Stream Tekton task logs for a pipeline
stream, err := client.GetLogStream(ctx, pipelineID)
for {
    logEntry, err := stream.Recv()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break // Stream completed
    }
    // Process log entry: task_name, log_message, owner
}
```

**Key features**:
- Supports both HTTP (context-based API key) and STDIO (env-based API key) transports
- Automatic TLS selection based on endpoint (port 443 = TLS, others = insecure)
- Streaming response collection into JSON-serializable structs

### Log Streaming Tool

The `get_pipeline_build_logs` tool collects all streamed log entries and returns them as a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "task_name": "git-clone",
    "log_message": "Cloning repository https://github.com/acmecorp/backend-api.git"
  },
  {
    "task_name": "docker-build",
    "log_message": "npm install failed: ENOENT package.json"
  }
]
```

**Data flow**:
1. Tool receives `pipeline_id` from agent
2. Creates authenticated gRPC client
3. Opens log stream to backend API
4. Backend sources logs from Redis (running) or R2 (completed)
5. Tool collects all log entries
6. Returns complete log array as JSON

### Pipeline Metadata Tool

The `get_pipeline_by_id` tool provides execution context:

```json
{
  "id": "pipe-xyz789",
  "service_id": "svc-abc123",
  "commit_sha": "abc123def456",
  "branch": "main",
  "status": {
    "progress_status": "WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STATUS_FAILED",
    "progress_result": "WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_RESULT_FAILED",
    "build_stage": {
      "status": "WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STATUS_FAILED",
      "result": "WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_RESULT_FAILED"
    }
  }
}
```

### Proto Schema Alignment

Updated implementation to match actual proto structure:

**Commit info**: Accessed via nested `GitCommit` object
```go
// Correct: pipeline.GetSpec().GetGitCommit().GetSha()
// Wrong: pipeline.GetSpec().GetCommitSha() ❌
```

**Audit timestamps**: Accessed via `ApiResourceAudit.StatusAudit`
```go
// Correct: audit.GetStatusAudit().GetCreatedAt()
// Wrong: audit.GetCreatedAt() ❌
```

This required careful review of the proto definitions to ensure proper field access.

## Benefits

### For AI Agents

- **Autonomous troubleshooting**: Agents can diagnose build failures without human intervention
- **Root cause analysis**: Access to full error messages and stack traces from logs
- **Historical analysis**: Review logs from past builds to identify patterns
- **Real-time monitoring**: Stream logs from in-progress builds
- **Complete context**: Combine metadata (pipeline status) with logs (what happened)

### For Users

- **Conversational debugging**: "Why did my build fail?" → Agent analyzes logs and explains
- **Faster resolution**: No need to manually review logs in the web console
- **Better insights**: Agents can correlate logs across multiple failed builds
- **Learning from failures**: Agents can suggest fixes based on similar past failures

### Example Workflow

**User**: "Why did my backend-api service build fail?"

**Agent workflow**:
1. `list_services_for_org()` → Find service
2. `get_service_by_org_by_slug()` → Get service details
3. `get_pipeline_by_id()` → Check latest pipeline status
4. `get_pipeline_build_logs()` → Fetch build logs
5. **Analyze logs** → Find: `"npm install failed: ENOENT package.json"`
6. **Suggest fix** → "Missing package.json in repository root"

**Before this change**: Agent could only say "The build failed" (no logs)  
**After this change**: Agent identifies exact error and suggests specific fix

## Impact

### Immediate

- Troubleshooting agents can now access build logs via MCP
- Foundation complete for autonomous build failure diagnosis
- Users can debug build issues conversationally

### Medium-term

- Enables next phase: Automated fix suggestions based on log analysis
- Pattern detection across build failures
- Integration with code generation for fix commits

### Developer Experience

- Clear domain organization makes adding new pipeline tools straightforward
- Consistent error handling patterns across all tools
- Streaming response collection pattern reusable for other tools

## Design Decisions

### Why collect all logs into an array vs. streaming to agent?

**Decision**: Collect all log entries and return complete JSON array

**Rationale**:
- MCP tool responses are single-shot (not streaming to client)
- Agents need complete context to analyze logs
- Build logs are typically small enough to fit in memory (< 1MB)
- Simplifies agent logic (no need to handle streaming)

**Trade-off**: Large log outputs could be truncated, but in practice build logs are manageable

### Why separate `get_pipeline_by_id` from `get_pipeline_build_logs`?

**Decision**: Two separate tools instead of combined metadata+logs

**Rationale**:
- Often only metadata is needed (check if build failed)
- Logs can be large - don't fetch them unnecessarily
- Follows single-responsibility principle
- Allows agents to make informed decisions (check status first, then get logs if needed)

**Alternative considered**: Single tool with optional `include_logs` flag - rejected as less clear for agent usage

### Why not filter logs by task name?

**Decision**: Return all logs, let agents filter

**Rationale**:
- Backend API doesn't support task-level filtering
- Agents need full context to understand task dependencies
- Log volumes are small enough to return everything
- Simpler implementation and API

**Future enhancement**: Could add client-side filtering if needed

## Known Limitations

- **Log size**: Very large logs (> 10MB) could be truncated by JSON response size limits
- **Real-time streaming**: Logs collected and returned as batch, not streamed to agent
- **No filtering**: All logs returned; agents must filter client-side if needed
- **No search**: No full-text search within logs (future enhancement)
