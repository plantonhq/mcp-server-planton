  "description": "OpenStackFloatingIpAssociate is a Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) style\n resource for associating an OpenStack Neutron floating IP with a port.\n\n This is a \"join\" resource that connects two independently managed resources:\n   - A floating IP (allocated via OpenStackFloatingIp)\n   - A port (created via OpenStackNetworkPort)\n\n In InfraCharts, this component appears as a visible DAG node with dependency\n edges to both the floating IP and the port, making the association relationship\n explicit and transparent.\n\n Use this component when:\n   - The floating IP and port are managed as separate InfraChart components\n   - You need DAG visibility of the association relationship\n   - The floating IP allocation is decoupled from its use\n\n Use OpenStackFloatingIp.spec.port_id instead when:\n   - Allocation and association happen together in a single manifest\n   - DAG visibility of the association is not needed",
